<h3 align="center">Passionate about all things AI/ML, with a focus on NLP and Recommender Systems</h3>
<h4 align='center'>(because who doesnâ€™t want to know what to binge-watch next?).</h4>

<p align='center'>Currently deep-diving into <b>Transformers, making sense of words, data, and everything in between</b>. I thrive on challengesâ€”be it making sense of complex algorithms or figuring out why my code isnâ€™t running (spoiler: <i>it's usually a typo</i>). My curiosity fuels my love for uncovering insights that help drive smarter decision-making.</p>

- ðŸ”­ Working on [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/ditherr)

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning **Transformers focused on NLP and Recommender System**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Data, ML, AI, NLP**

- âš¡ Fun fact I'm **a Typos. a Doer** and.... **ðŸ¤«"The Mona Lisa has no eyebrows."**


<p align='center'><b>Challenges? I love them</b>. Curiosity? Itâ€™s my superpower. And <b>lifelong learning? Well, thatâ€™s a journey Iâ€™m always on.</b></p>
